Project Title: SQL Mastery Showcase

### Overview
Welcome to my SQL Mastery Showcase project! This project is specially crafted to demonstrate my comprehensive SQL skills and knowledge. As a dedicated member of Bespoke International Group, I present this project to showcase my passion for problem-solving through SQL.

### Introduction
In this project, I have meticulously designed and implemented a SQL database. The database schema includes a carefully curated "Characters" table, mirroring Death Note characters, to explore various SQL operations.

### Database Schema
The "Characters" table serves as the foundation of this project. This table incorporates the essential components of a real-world database, such as primary keys, data types, constraints, and auto-incrementing fields. The schema ensures data integrity while enabling seamless data manipulation.

### SQL Queries
This project showcases a series of SQL queries that demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of the language. Some highlight queries include:

- Retrieving character names and roles from the "Characters" table.
- Filtering and sorting characters based on their power levels.
- Identifying the highest power level character using ORDER BY and LIMIT.
- Updating character roles to display anti-hero traits.
- Inserting new characters with their respective roles and power levels.
- Skillfully removing characters from the table using DELETE and WHERE clauses.

### Conclusion
This project reflects my unwavering commitment to excellence in SQL and problem-solving. I am eager to contribute my SQL expertise to unlock the full potential of data.

Thank you for considering me.

Best regards,
Philani Kemele
